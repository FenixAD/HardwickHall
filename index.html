      <h1 class="project-name">Hardwick Hall</h1>
      <p>A beautiful example of the height of Elizabethan architecture from the mullioned windows to the massive Long Gallery spanning 50 metres in length, Hardwick Hall is a must-see when visiting Derbyshire and the surrounding counties!

      <p>Despite being designed by the prestigious Renaissance architect, Robert Smythson, the real orchestrator of this magnificent manor house is Bess of Hardwick. After being widowed four times by increasingly prestigious men (ending with George Talot who left her as Countess of Shrewsbury) she had so much affluence from her husbands’ wills that she was the wealthiest woman in England after Queen Elizabeth I herself. In the illustrious time of the ‘Great Rebuilding’, what better way to display her rise from the daughter of destitute gentry to successful Countess than to build a gorgeous home next to Hardwick Manor - the building she grew up in?
</p>
      <p>At the age of 63 in 1590 she began the huge project involving 375 workmen to build her stately home than would later be known - affectionately I’m sure - as ‘Hardwick Hall: more glass than wall’. She moved into the elegant stone building on 4th October 1597 and basked in the highly fashionable (though, like most Elizabethan buildings, hallway-less) Hall with rooms fit for a Queen - which her granddaughter Arbella had every chance of one day being.

      <h3>The Long Gallery </h3>

      <p>If there’s any one room you should see in Hardwick Hall, it would have to be this goliath of an entertainment room found - like all Long Galleries - on the upper floors of the building. Captivating tourists and nobles alike, though in slightly different ways, this long room was indeed a gallery displaying dazzling renaissance art amongst the alabaster fireplaces connecting to the newly-invented chimneys. It was also, however, used to have a chat, exercise, play sports like badminton and even to dance! Walking down this huge room is like strolling right into the heart of Elizabethan leisure.

      <h3>The Withdrawing Room</h3>

      <p>If enthralling, historically rich decoration is more you style, you might be interested in the Withdrawing Chamber. This intricately decorated room is where Bess would have taken her guests for a slightly more private environment to entertain them in, so called as they would “withdraw” to this room, often from a dinner or banquet. As soon as you walk into this room your eyes will immediately be drawn to the magnificent carvings of Apollo and the Nine Muses intermingling with the Royal Coat of Arms - Bess’ efforts to impress Queen Elizabeth and declare loyalty to her. What’s more are the wonderful tapestries of Flemish origins depicting the story of a Roman general. You can stand there for hours just taking in all the amazing details!

      <h3>The Great Hall</h3>

      <p>If you’re still hungry for more Elizabethan architecture, the Great Hall (also known as the Entrance Hall) features some of the most beautiful decorations of the building. Being one of the first rooms visitors will see, the Great Hall is decorated and furnished to the highest standard possible. This room has one of the largest fireplaces in the manor with an equally impressive overmantel decorated with stone carvings and plasterwork with details such as coats of arms. Being at the front of Hardwick Hall, this room shows of the huge mullioned windows that were highly fashionable at the time due to the increased availability of glass and earned Hardwick Hall its reputation as ‘more glass than wall. Entered through a screens passage at one end, this room could be used for any number of things from receiving guests to sleeping in, depending on who you were in the household!
